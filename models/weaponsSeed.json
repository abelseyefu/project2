Sasuke's sword is quite long and allows him to deal a lot of damage to those he fights.Sasuke is also able to channel electricity through the Kusanagi sword to increase its cutting power. At its best, this blade was able to cute through Kubikiribocho, which makes it one of the best Naruto weapons. Sasuke replaced his Kusanagi blade after the Fourth Great Ninja War but whether it has any new abilities or not remains to be seen."

Shurado allows any Rinnegan user to summon various mechanized armor and even other weapons such as energy cannons.Very few people have made use of this Path and while it might not look as impressive as the other Paths, it is certainly quite useful. Shurado packs tremendous power when compared to your average Naruto weapons, depending on which weapon it is using. Shurado's abilities have earned it the name of Warring Demon, which just goes to show the fear that it instills in the enemies."
