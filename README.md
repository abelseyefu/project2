About
My project is an armory or a weapon's Smith that allows a user to add a weapon to a users armory from the popular anime Naruto Shippuden. It contains information about the show that fans will enjoy and have the oppertunity to interact with the weapons and make it their own.

 Goals: 
 To add Oauth and authentication into the project 
 
 To make the User more dynamic
